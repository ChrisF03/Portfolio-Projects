# Data-In-Motion SQL Case Studies
- These SQL case studies are free case studies designed by [DataInMotion](https://d-i-motion.com/) to help data analysts practice and hone their skills by simulating real-world business problems and challenging participants to query for solutions. Below you will find my solutions to both case studies.

## CASE STUDY #2 : [Human Resources Analysis](https://github.com/ChrisF03/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Projects/dataInMotion%20Case%20Studies/CaseStudy2_(HumanResources).md)
- This case study allows us to query a PostgreSQL database as an analyst for Human Reosurces department.<br><br>
