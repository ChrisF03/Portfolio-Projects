# Data-In-Motion SQL Case Studies
- These SQL case studies are free case studies designed by [DataInMotion](https://d-i-motion.com/) to help data analysts practice and hone their skills by simulating real-world business problems and challenging participants to query for solutions. Below I will post my solutions to each case study as I solve them.

## CASE STUDY #1 : [Tiny Shop Sales](https://github.com/ChrisF03/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Projects/dataInMotion%20Case%20Studies/CaseStudy1_(TinyShop).md)
- This case study allows us to query a PostgreSQL database for customer order analysis of a tiny shop.<br><br>
- Aggregate functions, JOINS, and CTE's were used throughout the analysis.

**Questions Answered :**
1. Which product has the highest price? Only return a single row.
2. Which customer has made the most orders?
3. What’s the total revenue per product?
4. Find the day with the highest revenue.
5. Find the first order (by date) for each customer.
6. Find the top 3 customers who have ordered the most distinct products
7. Which product has been bought the least in terms of quantity?
8. What is the median order total?
9. For each order, determine if it was ‘Expensive’ (total over 300), ‘Affordable’ (total over 100), or ‘Cheap’.
10. Find customers who have ordered the product with the highest price.
