# Supply Chain Analysis

- As the world leader in research and development, the U.S is always on the bleeding edge of innovation, medical advancement not being an exception. Since approving the first HIV/AIDS drug in 1987, the U.S.A has been the largest exporter of medication for this disease in the world.

- Using data from the United States Agency for International Development, I decided to analyze supply chain pricing and shipment data for these medications from 2006 - 2015 only using Excel.

- The dataset contained 33 columns and 10,325 rows covering information on everything from vendors, brands, order and delivery dates, pricing, shipment methods, and costs and I used the following functions to facilitate my analysis : =TEXT() and =IF().

- After getting the data how I wanted it, I created Pivot Tables on a seperate page to analyze the data and create visualizations for my final dashboard which included a slicer for year.

**<ins>Some questions I tried to answer</ins> :**  

Which countries are receiving these exports ? <br>
Which vendors are selling the most ? <br>
What are the most transported brands ? <br>

<!-- ##### - Used MS Excel to analyze 10,325 supply chain shipments and commodity pricing for HIV/AIDS medication from the U.S. from 2006-2015.

##### - Leveraged Pivot Tables to put together visualizations for a \textbf{filterable dashboard} containing information on top vendors, receiving countries, total shipments, etc by year.

##### - Discovered that 89\% of all shipments were on time and that generic brand drugs were the most transported with total costs amounting to $47.5 million.-->
