# Adidas US Sales Analysis Dashboard

The objective of this data analysis project is to delve into Adidas U.S. sales data spanning from 2020 to 2022. By leveraging Microsoft Excel, we aim to uncover valuable insights into sales patterns across various dimensions, including regions, sales methods, retailers, and dates. The project's scope encompasses the creation of visualizations to facilitate a clear understanding of trends and potential areas for optimization.

### Key Findings:

- The east coast and west coast, respectively, were the highest-performing regions; Midwest and the South were the worst-performing.
- Most sales (40%) were in-store, followed by outlets (33%), and online (28%).
- West Gear and Foot Locker, respectively, were the top performing retailer with Walmart and Amazon doing the worst.
- 2020 was a very low-selling year due to COVID, making up only 20.23% of sales in the two-year span covered, however across both years sales seemed to peak in the spring and summer months.

### Recommendations:

- Consider reallocating resources to focus on high-performing regions.
- Optimize sales methods based on their historical effectiveness.
- Strengthen partnerships with top-performing retailers and explore opportunities for expansion.
- Leverage seasonal trends to plan marketing and promotional activities effectively.
